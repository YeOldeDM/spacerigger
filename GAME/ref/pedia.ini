[checklist_startup]

text="The following is the standard procedure checklist for a Cold Start of a spacecraft.\n\n > APU ON or EXT ON\n\n Engage the ship\'s APU device. Optionally, the ship\'s generator can be started via an external power source if one is provided. If external power is used, engage the ship\'s EXT power input valve.\n\n\n > Set Source selector\n\n The power source selector must be set to either APU or EXT, depending on which source is being used to start the generator.\n\n\n > GEN ON\n\n With a source of power, the ship\'s generator can now be fired up. Before the ship\'s engines can be ignited (and allow its pilot to utilize its thrusters), the generator must be operating at 100%.\n\n\n > Ignite\n\n Once the ship\'s generator output is at 100%, the Ignition switch will light up the ship\'s engines and give power to its thrusters.\n\n\n\n To shut down a spacecraft, simply disengage its generator. This will starve its thrusters of power. Once a ship is shut down in this manner, it must be started up again using the above procedure."
