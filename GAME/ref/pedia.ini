text="The Automated Flight Assist system uses your ship's onboard flight computer to control your ship's [url=system_RCS]RCS thrusters[/url] to orient your ship toward a desired direction."

[autopilot_RID]

text="The Relative Inertia Dampener system uses a series of gyroscopes and low-yield ion micro-pulses to cancel your ship's linear and angular velocity."

[system_clock]

text="This system displays the current Terran Greenwich Mean Time (TGMT).\n\n
This module also includes an auxillary timer with Start, Stop, and Clear user controls."

[system_RCS]

text="Your ship's Reaction Control System is a series of small thrusters arranged around the frame of the ship. While a ship's main thrusters
do the bulk of the work in propelling a ship, the RCS thrusters are used for fine adjustments as well as altering the yaw of the ship."

text="This module controls your ship's onboard [url=tech_ALEPH]ALEPH drive[/url].\n
When your ship is within the proximity of a Warp Node's influence, this module will display the name of the Node, as well as its destination.\n
\nPressing the Engage button while within a Warp Node's influence will jump your ship to that Node's destination."

[tech_ALEPH]

text="The phenomenon known as Accelleration through Linearized Emission of Polarized Hadrons. Specialized deviced aboard most small spacecraft, commonly called the Aleph Drive, allow vessels to travel across vast distances of space in relatively short amounts of time. The ALEPH Drive is fueled by a substance known as [url=resource_hadrium]Hadrium[/url]."

[checklist_startup]

text="The following is the standard procedure checklist for a Cold Start of a spacecraft.\n
 > APU ON or EXT ON\n
 Engage the ship's APU device. Optionally, the ship's generator can be started via an external power source if one is provided. If external power is used, engage the ship's EXT power input valve.\n\n
 > Set Source selector\n
 The power source selector must be set to either APU or EXT, depending on which source is being used to start the generator.\n\n
 > GEN ON\n
 With a source of power, the ship's generator can now be fired up. Before the ship's engines can be ignited (and allow its pilot to utilize its thrusters), the generator must be operating at 100%.\n\n
 > Ignite\n
 Once the ship's generator output is at 100%, the Ignition switch will light up the ship's engines and give power to its thrusters.\n\n\n
 To shut down a spacecraft, simply disengage its generator. This will starve its thrusters of power. Once a ship is shut down in this manner, it must be started up again using the above procedure."
