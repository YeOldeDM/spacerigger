text="The Relative Inertia Dampener system uses a series of gyroscopes and low-yield ion micro-pulses to cancel your ship's linear and angular velocity."

[system_clock]

text="This system displays the current Terran Greenwich Mean Time (TGMT).\n\n
This module also includes an auxillary timer with Start, Stop, and Clear user controls."

[system_RCS]

text="Your ship's Reaction Control System is a series of small thrusters arranged around the frame of the ship. While a ship's main thrusters
do the bulk of the work in propelling a ship, the RCS thrusters are used for fine adjustments as well as altering the yaw of the ship."

text="This module controls your ship's onboard [url=tech_ALEPH]ALEPH drive[/url].\n
When your ship is within the proximity of a Warp Node's influence, this module will display the name of the Node, as well as its destination.\n
\nPressing the Engage button while within a Warp Node's influence will jump your ship to that Node's destination."

text="The phenomenon known as Accelleration through Linearized Emission of Polarized Hadrons. Specialized deviced aboard most small spacecraft, commonly called the Aleph Drive, allow vessels to travel across vast distances of space in relatively short amounts of time. The ALEPH Drive is fueled by a substance known as [url=resource_hadrium]Hadrium[/url]."
